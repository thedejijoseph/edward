Automatically connect via WhatsApp..

I saw a site built for or by KitanDavid. It functioned as a form to collect phone numbers and then encouraged you to save a number displayed.

The process effectively connected you with KitanDavid (asuming you saved the number). Hence, I thought KitanDavid must be automatically (he couldn't be possibly doing it manually) saving the submitted phone numbers to his contact list, in order to complete the connection.

Now that I think about it, he could have "imported" contacts from a CSV file. Anywho, should I finish building it, that's what it will do.
